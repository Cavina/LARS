# Foreword

If you are reading this guide, it likely means you or someone you care about has been diagnosed with colorectal cancer. I am deeply sorry for this challenging chapter in your life. This journey will test you in many ways, evolving as you move forward. My hope is that this guide helps make the path a little clearer and brings the day when this is a distant memory closer to reality.

# How to Use This Guide

This guide is based on my personal experience recovering from Stage 1 rectal cancer. After the removal of my rectum and a large portion of my sigmoid colon, I navigated recovery without radiation or chemotherapy but did have a temporary ileostomy bag for three months. Following surgery, I dedicated a year to experimenting with diets, foods, and strategies to manage my symptoms effectively. 

I spent the majority of the year in Phase 1. I would develop a strategy to go beyond it, but it would always fail. 
The insights in this guide reflect what worked for me, but every person’s body, microbiome, and experience with LARS (Low Anterior Resection Syndrome) are unique. Think of this as a resource for inspiration rather than a strict plan. I am not a doctor, and this guide is not a replacement for medical advice. It is a compilation of strategies to help you rebuild your ability to digest fiber and regain control of your symptoms.

As you explore these ideas, use common sense and intuition, and maintain a high water intake while incorporating fiber supplements.

# Introduction

## LARS & Recovery

Recovering from colorectal surgery can vary significantly depending on the type and location of the resection. Some patients recover quickly with minimal disruption, while others face challenges such as frequency, incontinence, and constipation. These symptoms collectively fall under the umbrella of Low Anterior Resection Syndrome (LARS).

## My Experience with LARS

My journey included frequent and urgent trips to the restroom, often at night, disrupting my sleep. Foods like garlic, onion, gluten, and insoluble fiber triggered extreme bloating, frequent urges, and loose stools.

### Symptoms I Faced:
- Incontinence  
- Bloating and cramps  
- Clustering (frequent, consecutive bowel movements)  
- Mood swings  
- Lack of sleep  

For much of that year, I subsisted on a simplified diet of eggs, white rice, chicken or tofu, and fermented vegetables—foods my body could tolerate. Guided by research and advice from doctors and nutritionists, I focused on defining my problems and working toward solutions.

### Key Challenges:
1. **Inability to control bowel movements** due to neuromuscular disconnect.  
2. **Difficulty achieving full evacuation** due to inadequate stool bulk.  
3. **Intolerance to certain foods**, including FODMAPs and fibrous items.  

These challenges informed the goals of my recovery plan:
- Improve bowel control through physical exercises (e.g., Kegels).  
- Achieve better stool bulk using dietary strategies and fiber supplements.  
- Gradually reintroduce insoluble fiber to restore tolerance.

This journey unfolded in three phases:  
1. **Bulking the Stool**  
2. **Increasing Insoluble Fiber Intake**  
3. **Ongoing Maintenance**

## Phase 1: Bulking the Stool

### Fiber Supplements

Psyllium husk became my go-to supplement after experimenting with Metamucil, which caused loose stools. Capsules proved more consistent than powder.

To find the optimal dosage, I gradually increased my intake, noting the effects over several days. Once I experienced loose stool, I reduced the dosage to the previous level that worked.

### Key Observations:
- Large quantities of food provided better bulk but were impractical.  
- Flat rice noodles (e.g., those in Pad See Ew) consistently offered the best stool bulk.

## Phase 2: Increasing Insoluble Fiber Intake

The only way to retrain your gut to digest fiber is by eating more of it, which initially exacerbates symptoms. Imodium helped by slowing digestion, giving my body time to process fiber. Simethicone was also useful in managing bloating.

I started by taking one Imodium with a low-fiber meal and gradually introduced higher-fiber foods, such as oatmeal, nuts, and leafy greens. When constipation occurred, I paused the Imodium but maintained the high-fiber diet.

### Cycle:
1. Introduce fiber slowly, paired with Imodium.  
2. Pause Imodium when constipation arises.  
3. Continue the diet during reset periods.  

**Repeat the cycle as needed** until your body adjusts to a higher fiber intake. Over time, you may find that you no longer need Imodium to tolerate fibrous foods.  

After two weeks, I was tolerating fibrous foods like raw greens, kiwi, and pomegranate without Imodium.

## Phase 3: Ongoing Maintenance

### Current Progress:
- No clustering or incontinence.  
- Fully bulked stool.  
- ~2 bowel movements daily, with one at night.  

### Meal Timing & Diet:
To align with my digestive cycle, I’ve adjusted meal timings and continue to avoid triggers like garlic, onion, gluten, and fried foods.

# Key Takeaways

- Bulked stool alleviates symptoms.  
- Insoluble fiber bulks stool but speeds up motility.  
- Soluble fiber slows digestion.  
- Imodium can help manage symptoms temporarily while increasing fiber intake.  

A balanced combination of soluble and insoluble fiber, along with symptom management tools like Imodium and Simethicone, can help restore your ability to digest fiber and manage LARS symptoms effectively.
